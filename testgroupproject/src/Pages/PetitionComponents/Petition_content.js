      content: [
        `I want the government to make it a legal requirement for housing with acceptable roofing to be used as a platform to install solar panels as a renewable energy source. This would not only benefit the whole of the UK, as our carbon footprint would be reduced but also the energy price for the owner of the house.`,
        `The reason this is specifically during the building process is that it would be cheaper to have the solar panels all planned and fitted during the construction stage than post-construction. If solar panels are taken into consideration before the house has been built, the roof can be angled effectively to maximise solar power generation. I would envision the bill to be worded with the inclusion of a minimum solar panel limit per size of home. This bill would show that houses can be built with renewable energy in mind, paving the way to new ways of efficient renewable energy in the UK.`,

           Therefore, the government must take all the energy assets into its own hands so more schemes can be created. Which will help push toward a renewable energy-driven future.
